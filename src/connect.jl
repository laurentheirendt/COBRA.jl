    createPool(localWorkers, connectSSHWorkers, connectionFile)

Function used to create a pool of parallel workers that are either local or connected via SSH.

# INPUTS

- `localWorkers`:   Number of local workers to connect.
                    If `connectSSH` is `true`, the number of localWorkers is 1 (host).

# OPTIONAL INPUTS

- `connectSSH`:     Boolean that indicates whether additional nodes should be connected via SSH.
                    (default: `false`)
- `connectionFile`  Name of the file with the SSH connection details (default: config/sshCfg.jl in the `COBRA` package installation folder)

# OUTPUTS

- `workers()`:      Array of IDs of the connected workers (local and SSH workers)
- `nWorkers`:       Total number of connect workers (local and SSH workers)

# EXAMPLES

Minimum working example:
```julia
julia> createPool(localWorkers)
```

Local workers and workers on SSH nodes can be connected as follows:
```julia
workersPool, nWorkers = createPool(12, true, "mySSHCfg.jl")
```
which will connect 12 local workers, and all workers defined in `mySSHCfg.jl`. An example connection file is provided in the `config/` folder of the `COBRA` package installation folder.

See also: `workers()`, `nprocs()`, `addprocs()`, `gethostname()`
